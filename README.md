# Let-your-LLM-know-you

The purpose of this project is to enable an LLM to respond to messages as if they were coming from you. To achieve this, we focus on methods for providing the LLM with additional user-specific information. By leveraging techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), in-context learning, and prompt engineering, we aim to improve the LLM's ability to generate accurate and personalized responses.

## Contact-Context-Prompting

One example is using a contact database that includes names, phone numbers, relationship levels, and typical tones used when addressing each contact. By matching the sender’s name or phone number, we can provide additional context in the prompt to tailor the LLM’s responses based on the relationship and communication style.
